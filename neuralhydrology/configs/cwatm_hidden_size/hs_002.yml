# specify how many random basins to use for validation
validate_n_random_basins: 1

# specify which metrics to calculate during validation (see neuralhydrology.evaluation.metrics)
# this can either be a list or a dictionary. If a dictionary is used, the inner keys must match the name of the
# target_variable specified below. Using dicts allows for different metrics per target variable.

# Forcing product [daymet, maurer, maurer_extended, nldas, nldas_extended, nldas_hourly]
# can be either a list of forcings or a single forcing product
forcings: 

# variables to use as time series input (names match the data file column headers)
# Note: In case of multiple input forcing products, you have to append the forcing product behind
# each variable. E.g., 'prcp(mm/day)' of the daymet product is 'prcp(mm/day)_daymet'
# To use different dynamic inputs per frequency, this variable must contain a dict mapping each frequency to its
# list of variables. E.g., to use precipitation from daymet for daily and from nldas_hourly for hourly predictions:
#   1D:
#     - prcp(mm/day)_daymet
#   1H:
#     - total_precipitation_nldas_hourly
dynamic_inputs:
  - Precipitation
  - Tavg

# which columns to use as target
target_variables:
  - discharge

# clip negative predictions to zero for all variables listed below. Should be a list, even for single variables.
clip_targets_to_zero:
  - discharge

# Which CAMELS attributes to use. Leave empty if none should be used
static_attributes:

  # Path to pickle file(s) containing additional data. Each pickle file must contain a dictionary
# with one key for each basin and the value is a time indexed data frame, where each column is a 
# feature.
# Convention: If a column is used as static input, the value to use for specific sample should be in
# same row (datetime) as the target discharge value.
additional_feature_files:

# columns of the data frame to use as (additional) "static" inputs for each sample. Must be present in
# the above linked additional feature files. These values will be used as static inputs, but they can evolve over time.
# Leave empty to not use any.
evolving_attributes:

# whether to use basin id one hot encoding as (additional) static input
use_basin_id_encoding: True
